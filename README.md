# Welcome to my GitHub profile

I recently moved many of my projects to "private" because they were not as useful as they use to be. I hope yo replace them with new work very soon and I have already started with this in small increments.

---

Some things I am working on:

- [gideon.dev](https://gideon.dev) - I completed the refactoring of my portfolio but just like me it will continue to evolve. I hope you take a moment to visit it. The project is built using React.js and Next.js. I still have a bunch of things I wan to improve and do with it.

- [Shortento.com](https://shortento.com) - is a new MVP project I am starting with. The site is a service that will allow you to create permanent links to digital resources. The concept is very simple and I hope to differentiate it well and build something that everyone will understand the value of. I am not sure that this is the best name for the service, but hopefully some feedback will help me with something better.

- [Test53.com](https://test53.com) - I am redeveloping Test53 at the moment. This is a passion project and I spend my free time on it. I hope yo get this project to a point where I can get more support for it and maybe some more people to asssit building the best DNS diagnostic and security tool on the web.

- The RSYNC automation project `python-rsync-backup` is now available in version 2. Vesion 1 is still available but considered EOL.

- I want to contribute my first PyPi.com project soon and I think i have the perfect idea for something that is within my skill level and will be useful.

- I am experimenting with messaging services at the momoment and when I am ready I would like to share that code with everyone. I am building it as a "Self-hosted" solution and think it can be a very helpful tool.
