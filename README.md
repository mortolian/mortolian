# Welcome to my GitHub Profile

I recently moved many of my projects to "private" because they were getting old and did not represent my current level of knowledge and skill. I hope to add some new projects I have been working on soon.

Some things I am working on:

- I am redeveloping Test53.com at the moment. This is a passion project and teaches me a bunch. I hope to release a version of this in the last quarter of 2022.

- I just tested my own RSYNC automation project "python-rsync-backup" and will have a version 2 available soon. Backup solutions out there did not really get things done the way I wanted it to.

- I am starting a new project called "Shortento.com". The idea is to build a platform that helps you link your resources in all kinds of different ways using DNS and Link shorteners. I think it will be an amazing and challenging project to work on.
