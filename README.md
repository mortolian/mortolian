# Welcome to my GitHub Space

### This is where I keep all my code and contribute to other projects.

- [ ] I am currently working on Test53 a lot. This is just a learning project which I hope can be helpful to a lot of people out there.
- [ ] I am also updating my Python backup application and should be done soon.

- ðŸ’¬ You are always welcome to ask me about anything in the `CSS, HTML, PHP, JAVASCRIPT, PYTHON` space and I will see if I can help.
