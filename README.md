# 👋 Hi, I’m Gideon a.k.a. Mortolian

Senior DevOps / Platform Architect focused on building **reliable, scalable systems** that support real businesses and real teams.

My open-source work reflects how I design, automate, and maintain production systems — with clarity, pragmatism, and long-term operability in mind.

---

## 🧭 What I Do

I design and evolve platforms at the intersection of:

- Cloud infrastructure & Kubernetes
- Automation, CI/CD, and GitOps
- Data-driven systems and AI-enabled workflows
- Engineering practices that scale with teams

I’m especially interested in *reducing operational friction* and *making complex systems boring to run*.

---

## 🛠 How I Work

- I favor **simple architectures that age well**
- I automate to reduce cognitive load, not to impress
- I document decisions so systems are understandable years later
- I treat infrastructure as a product, not a side effect

If you’re reviewing my profile as part of a hiring or collaboration process:  
**this GitHub is intentionally representative of how I think and build.**

## 📂 Selected Work

These repositories are small by design and production-minded in approach:

| Project | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| **iac-ansible** | Practical automation patterns for infrastructure |
| **rsync-remote-backup** | Reliable backup tooling with operational clarity |
| **code-js-cidr** | Networking utilities built for correctness and reuse |
| **code-js-tictactoe** | Simple system with tests — intentionally readable |

Each project reflects design choices I’d stand behind in production.

If you’re evaluating technical depth, system thinking, or engineering judgment,  
**I’m happy to discuss the design decisions behind any of my work instead of doing contrived coding tests.**
