# Welcome to my GitHub Space

### This is where I keep all my code and contribute to other projects.

- [ ] I am also updating my Python backup application and should be done soon.

- ðŸ’¬ You are always welcome to ask me about anything in the `CSS, HTML, PHP, JAVASCRIPT, PYTHON` space and I will see if I can help.
- ðŸ’¬ I also have a lot of experience (7+ years) with `AGILE` in the software development space as well as other areas of any business and I am always willing to listen and possibly offer advice.
