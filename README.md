# Welcome to my GitHub profile

I recently moved many of my projects to "private" because they were getting old and did not represent my current level of knowledge and skill. I hope to add some new projects I have been working on soon.

Some things I am working on:

- My own RSYNC automation project "python-rsync-backup" is now available in version 2. Vesion 1 is still available but considered EOL.

- I am redeveloping [Test53.com](https://test53.com) at the moment. This is a passion project and teaches me a bunch. You can visit the site and see my progress. I hope to have the initial version complete before the end of 2022.

- I am starting a new project called "Shortento.com". The idea is to build a platform that helps you link your resources in all kinds of different ways using DNS and Link shorteners. I think it will be an amazing and challenging project to work on. I look forward to start work on the mock site soon.

- I just completed my new personal portfolio. Have a look and let me know what you think. [gideon.dev](https://gideon.dev)
